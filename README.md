## General Information
This project is my personal web developer portfolio website. This project is an improvement on two former versions of the website that has continued to evolve as I have learned new technologies and continue to build toward being employer competitive. It contains actual examples of my work including 2 collaborative coding projects and some exemplary homework assignments as well as links to my GitHub repository, deployed projects, my LinkedIn profile and resume. 

You can access my deployed website here: https://rachelrohrbach.github.io/react-portfolio/#/Projects
